  Submit the following to UMKC BlackBoard on Wednesday, October 7, 2015
    1. Source code: Compress your project folder. The folder must consist of all your source code
                    files. I will use this folder to run your application. Submit the source code 
                    on blackboard.
    2.  Project Report: This report contains assumptions, a UML diagram, Big-O of the significant
                      functions, and references.
    3. Individual Report: A short report (preferably one page only) for each team member. Each
                          team member should mention his/her contributions, and what was learned 
                          in the project, other comments. Further, each person should briefly mention 
                          the other team member’s contributions. You might lose 25% of the grade if you
                          don’t submit this report.
                          - Here’s the template for the individual report if you are working in a group:
